hello world.
my name is adrian nicholas de vera.
i live in quezon city, metro manila, philippines.
i'm stuck in our half-empty new apartment with no internet besides my crappy phone data connection, which at least is good enough for lightweight github pages.
trying to survive the covid quarantine lockdown. rent's ticking but can't work. no isp is installing service for the duration of the lockdown.
support me at paypal.me/nicdevera.
